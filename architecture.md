# California Legislative Reports Application Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for a landing page application that allows users to create legislative reports for specific California Legislative bills. The application will feature a clean, modern UI designed for lobbying firms and citizens, with webhook integration to an n8n workflow for report generation and PDF download functionality.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Components
1. **Landing Page**
   - Modern, sophisticated UI with responsive design
   - Clear call-to-action for report generation
   - Intuitive navigation and user flow

2. **Bill Selection Form**
   - Input field for California bill number
   - Validation for proper bill number format
   - Optional additional filters or search capabilities

3. **Report Generation Interface**
   - Progress indicator during report generation
   - Error handling for failed report generation
   - Success confirmation with download option

4. **User Data Collection**
   - Non-intrusive form for collecting user information
   - Analytics tracking for usage patterns
   - No authentication required

### Backend Integration
1. **Webhook Handler**
   - API endpoint to receive form submissions
   - Data validation and sanitization
   - Forwarding to n8n webhook

2. **n8n Webhook Integration**
   - External n8n workflow (managed by user)
   - Receives bill number and user data
   - Processes and generates the legislative report

3. **PDF Generation and Delivery**
   - Receives generated report content from n8n
   - Converts to downloadable PDF format
   - Provides download link to user

### Data Flow
1. User enters bill number and optional information
2. Frontend validates input and collects user data
3. Data is sent to webhook handler
4. Webhook handler forwards data to n8n webhook
5. n8n processes the request and generates report content
6. Report content is returned and converted to PDF
7. User is provided with download link for the PDF

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui for modern, clean interface
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Icons**: Lucide icons for consistent visual language
- **State Management**: React Context API for application state

### Backend Integration
- **API Handling**: Fetch API for webhook communication
- **PDF Processing**: Client-side PDF generation using appropriate library
- **Data Collection**: Local storage and API endpoints

## Additional Features (Potential)
1. **Report Preview**: Allow users to preview report before downloading
2. **Saved Reports**: Option to save previously generated reports
3. **Email Delivery**: Send PDF reports directly to user email
4. **Social Sharing**: Share report links on social media platforms
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide insights on bill report generation trends
6. **Feedback System**: Collect user feedback on report quality and usefulness

## Security Considerations
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Data minimization for user privacy
- Secure webhook communication

## Performance Considerations
- Optimized asset loading for fast initial page load
- Efficient state management to prevent re-renders
- Responsive design for all device types
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

This architecture provides a foundation for building a sophisticated, user-friendly application that meets the requirements while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
