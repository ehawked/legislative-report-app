# California Legislative Reports - Premium UI Redesign

## Design Direction
Creating a minimalist dark mode UI with clear navigation, inspired by Airbnb's component cycling approach. The design will maintain the same basic structure but emphasize the exclusive, comprehensive nature of the legislative reports.

## Key Design Elements

### Typography

### Interaction & Animation
- Smooth transitions between sections (Airbnb-style)

### Layout

## Mobile Considerations
