# Dashboard-Style Legislative Report Design

## Design Concept
Creating a minimalist, data-focused dashboard for legislative reports that prioritizes accuracy, clarity, and readability while supporting in-depth analysis. The design takes inspiration from modern CRM dashboards with clean card layouts, clear metrics, and visual data representations.

## Key Design Elements

### Layout Structure
- Clean, card-based dashboard with white cards on a subtle light background
- Top row of key metrics cards for at-a-glance information
- Middle section with data visualizations and comparative metrics
- Bottom section with detailed tables and activity logs
- Consistent spacing and alignment throughout

### Visual Style
- Minimalist design with ample white space within content areas
- Purple and indigo accent colors from the original website
- Rounded corners on all cards for a modern feel
- Subtle shadows for depth without overwhelming the interface
- Clear visual hierarchy through typography and spacing

### Typography
- Clean sans-serif font family (Inter or similar)
- Limited font sizes (3-4 sizes maximum) for consistency
- Bold weights for headers and key metrics
- Regular weight for body text and descriptions
- High contrast between text and background for readability

### Data Visualization
- Simple, clean charts without excessive decoration
- Consistent color scheme across all visualizations
- Clear labels and values directly on visualizations where possible
- Minimal grid lines and axes to reduce visual noise

### Interactive Elements
- Subtle hover states for interactive elements
- Clear filter controls for data refinement
- Dropdown menus for time period selection
- Expandable sections for additional details

## Content Organization

### Key Metrics Section
- Bill Number and Title (prominent)
- Current Status with visual indicator
- Key Dates (introduced, last action)
- Vote Count or Support Percentage
- Fiscal Impact Summary

### Analysis Visualizations
- Support/Opposition Breakdown (pie or donut chart)
- Timeline of Legislative Progress (line or milestone chart)
- Stakeholder Position Analysis (bar chart)
- Comparative Analysis with Similar Bills (if applicable)

### Detailed Information
- Bill Summary and Key Provisions
- Voting Records Table
- Stakeholder Positions Table
